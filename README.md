# Viral Omics Tutorial

Welcome to the tutorial page for the Viral omics bioinformatics session of the [NORBIS Summer School 2021](https://norbis.w.uib.no/activities/summerschool/)

## Learning Outcomes:
After completion of the NORBIS summer school, the participants will:

- Improved knowledge of biological background of NORBIS related fields.
- Knowledge about data types and methods for bioinformatic analysis in NORBIS related fields.

After completion of this virome workshop day the participants will:
- Have a better idea of what can they achieve using VIBRANT in their research
- Grasp a understanding that VIBRANT is one tool of of a rich ecosystem of tools that can be used to expand virome research
- Be able to discuss the use of bioinformatics tools for virome research, either in their field of study or generally in science.
