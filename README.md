# Viral Omics Tutorial

**Contact**: Patricia Tran :school: University of Wisconsin-Madison :email: ptran5@wisc.edu

Welcome to the tutorial page for the Viral omics bioinformatics session of the [NORBIS Summer School 2021](https://norbis.w.uib.no/activities/summerschool/)

## Learning Outcomes:
After completion of the NORBIS summer school, the participants will:

- Improved knowledge of biological background of NORBIS related fields.
- Knowledge about data types and methods for bioinformatic analysis in NORBIS related fields.

After completion of this virome workshop day the participants will:
- Have a better idea of what can they achieve using VIBRANT in their research
- Grasp a understanding that VIBRANT is one tool of of a rich ecosystem of tools that can be used to expand virome research
- Be able to discuss the use of bioinformatics tools for virome research, either in their field of study or generally in science.


## Prerequisites
A basic knowledge of the command line will be beneficials, and knowledge of commands such as `cd`, `ls`, `mkdir`, `mv`, `cp`, `head`, `tail`, as well as an understanding of file directory structure will be beneficial. 

If you'd like to brush up on those skills, I recommand the following tutorials prior to the workshop:

## Installation
To follow along this tutorial, you will need to install [VIBRANT](https://github.com/AnantharamanLab/VIBRANT), which is freely available at the link here. Detailed instructions on installing VIBRANT are found on its own github page, posted [here](https://github.com/AnantharamanLab/VIBRANT#requirements-).

The program VIBRANT has already been installed on the server for this summer school.
